# 2. Authentication with Auth0

## Status

accepted

## Context

Auth0 solves identity for us.

- [x] logging with different social accounts to the same profile
- [x] ui for authentication

We also researched Okta a bit, but we didn't compare it thoroughly.

## Decision

I've set up Auth0 early to bootstrap our development and reduce complexity of our solution.

## Consequences

We're limited to 7,000 active users on the free plan and the upgrades can get pricy.
